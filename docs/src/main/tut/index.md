`llsm` is a set of Scala libraries for working with Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy (LLSM) data. Features include:

* Read and parse LLSM metadata from raw LLSM data from the Janelia LabView
    application.
* Read LLSM raw data from the Janelia LabView application.
* Deskew LLSM volumes.
* Output LLSM volumes as OME-TIFF or HDF5.

`llsm` is underpinned by Typelevel and ImageJ/Fiji community libraries including `cats`, `imglib2` and `scifio`.

# Getting Started
`llsm` is divided into several sub-projects:

* `core` - processing libraries with limited dependencies (`imglib2`, `scifio`, `cats-core`).
* `api` - a Free monad based API/DSL for describing LLSM processing workflows
* `ij` - a set of plugins for ImageJ to accomplish some basic tasks
* `cli` - a command-line interface for LLSM dataset conversions

# Note
`llsm` is currently in pre-release. You should expect some bugs.
