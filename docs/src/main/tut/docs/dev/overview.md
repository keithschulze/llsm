# Overview

The `llsm` project is divided into several sub-projects:

- [`core`](core.html) - Core data I/O and processing functions
- `api` - Free monad based API/DSL for composing programs that process and I/O
    LLSM data
- `cli` - a command-line interface that allows conversions from raw LLSM datasets
    to OME-TIFF or BigDataViewer HDF5 datasets with all metadata encoded as an
    OME companion file.
- `ij` - A set of ImageJ/Fiji plugins that allows previewing or conversion of raw
    LLSM datasets.
