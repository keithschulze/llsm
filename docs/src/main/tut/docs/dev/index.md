# Developer Documentation

This section will provide information for developers interested in contributing
to `llsm` or who want to use `llsm` libraries in their applications. We will
aim to describe:

- Overall `llsm` library architecture
- Introduction to different sub-projects
- Documentation and examples for using `llsm` API
- Guidelines for contributing

Note: This documentation is a work in progress. [Scaladocs](../../api) for the
libraries are also available.
